# Usage
# -----
#
# my_sql environment config-file
#
# Goal
# ----
#
# Developer has a shell open. The current directory is the root of a Rails application.
# The Rails application uses a mysql database.
#
# Instead of opening script/console they want to connect to the mysql directly.
# But they don't want to look up the username and password, host, port etc. from
# the config/database.yml
#
# Instead they would simply type for example,
#
#   my_sql => opens mysql prompt with development database
#
#   my_sql test=> opens mysql prompt with test database
#
# Result:
#
# They are now in a mysql prompt.
