== Usage

 ruby dp_prompt.rb [environment] [yaml-file]

== Goal

Developer has a shell open. The current directory is the root of a Rails application.
The Rails application uses a mysql database.

Instead of opening script/console they want to connect to the mysql database directly. But they don't want to look up the username and password, host, port etc. from the config/database.yml

Instead they would simply set up and run these aliases, for example,

   my_dev  # opens mysql prompt with development database

   my_test # opens mysql prompt with test database

Result:

$ my_dev
Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 5
Server version: 5.1.30 MySQL Community Server (GPL)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.
