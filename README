Usage
-----

 ruby dp_prompt.rb [environment] [yaml-file]

Goal
----

Developer has a shell open. The current directory is the root of a Rails application.
The Rails application uses a mysql database.

Instead of opening script/console they want to connect to the mysql directly.
But they don't want to look up the username and password, host, port etc. from
the config/database.yml

Instead they would simply run these aliases, for example,

   my_sql => opens mysql prompt with development database

   my_sql test=> opens mysql prompt with test database

Result:

 They are now in a mysql prompt.
