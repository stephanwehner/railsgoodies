# Usage
# -----
#
# my_sql environment config-file
#
# Goal
# ----
#
# Developer has a shell open. The current directory is the root of a Rails application.
# The Rails application uses a mysql database.
#
# Instead of opening script/console they want to connect to the mysql directly.
# But they don't want to look up the username and password, host, port etc. from
# the config/database.yml
#
# Instead they would simply type for example,
#
#   my_sql => opens mysql prompt with development database
#
#   my_sql test=> opens mysql prompt with test database
#
# Result:
#
# They are now in a mysql prompt.
#
# Implementation
# At http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/password-security-user.html
# a comment points out this shell snippet
#
#   { printf '[client]\npassword=%s\n' xxxx |
#   3<&0 <&4 4<&- mysql --defaults-file=/dev/fd/3 -u myuser
#   } 4<&0
#
# in order to switch to a mysql prompt without revealing the password
# within the argument list of processes.
#
# In Ruby it turns out less cryptic.
