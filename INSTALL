1. Requirements

The application consists of a single Ruby script, rdb_prompt.rb. There are no dependencies beyond the standard Ruby installation. These libraries are used:

  * optparse
  * yaml
  * erb

2. Installation proper

Simple installation consists in saving the script, rdb_prompt.rb, on the filesystem. Then invoke with 

 * ruby /your/chosen/installation/path/rdb_prompt.rb

System-wide ordinary UNIX installation consists in saving the script under /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, or other according to your system policy, and making it executable.
